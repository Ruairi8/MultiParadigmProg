# Description:
Developing a shop/retail outlet program using csv files containing an initial shop cash balance and customer orders. The shop balance and stock of items should update after each order. The aim of this project, was to carry out the same functionality and output the same results using different types of programming style - both a procedural style and an object-oriented approach.
It also includes a 'live mode', where a user can specify what they want to buy, how many and also pay for it. The live mode should also have the same, or very similar behaviour in all implementations.

## Repository Contents:
- 5 csv files containing customer orders and cash balances
- shop csv file containing the initial shop cash balance, items in stock and the number of each item in stock
- Python file with object-oriented approach, 'OO-Shop.py'
- Python file with procedural approach, 'Procedural_Shop.py'
- Written report comparing the solutions that were achieved.
- C language file, 'c_Shop.c'

## Requirements:
